# Executive Summary

<Purpose>
The Executive Summary provides a high-level, non-technical overview of the solution architecture, tailored for senior leadership, sponsors, and non-technical stakeholders. It captures the essence of the architecture’s purpose, business alignment, strategic goals, and major outcomes without delving into detailed technical descriptions. The Executive Summary ensures that decision-makers quickly understand the value, direction, and critical importance of the architecture within the broader enterprise landscape.

<Instructions>
1. **Summarize the Business Problem and Solution:** Provide a brief, clear description of the business problem or opportunity the architecture addresses. Follow it immediately with a simple explanation of the proposed solution—what it is, what it does, and how it helps.
2. **Highlight Strategic Alignment:**  Connect the architecture to key organizational strategies, corporate initiatives, or business goals. Show how the solution fits into the company’s long-term plans for growth, operational excellence, risk reduction, or innovation.
3. **State Key Outcomes and Benefits:**  List the major expected outcomes, such as improved customer satisfaction, increased revenue, operational efficiency, risk mitigation, regulatory compliance, or innovation enablement. Keep the focus on business value rather than technical features.
4. **Mention Major Architectural Features at a High Level:**  Name important components (e.g., major platforms, cloud services, critical systems) but avoid detailed technical language. Describe them in terms of their business contribution.
5. **Include a Call to Action (Optional):** If appropriate, close the summary with a clear next step, such as "endorsement for funding," "approval to proceed," or "review by architectural governance board."
6. **Keep the Tone Executive-Friendly:**  Write in plain, professional language. Avoid jargon, acronyms without explanation, or deep technical detail. Focus on clarity, brevity, and relevance.

<Example>
The Customer Digital Onboarding Initiative modernizes and streamlines the account creation process for new residential and commercial customers, reducing onboarding time by 50% and improving customer satisfaction by 15%. This solution aligns directly with the company’s strategic goals of operational excellence and digital-first engagement.

# Architecture Vision

<Purpose>
The Vision Statement section outlines the overarching goals and aspirations of the architecture project. It provides a clear and concise description of the desired future state that the architecture aims to achieve. This section should inspire and guide stakeholders by articulating the long-term vision and strategic direction.

<Instructions>
1. **Understand the Context:** Review the business goals, strategic objectives, and key drivers for the architecture project. Engage with stakeholders to gather their perspectives and expectations.
2. **Define the Vision:** Craft a vision statement that is forward-looking, inspirational, and aligned with the organization's strategic goals. Ensure it is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
3. **Validate the Vision:** Share the draft vision statement with key stakeholders for feedback. Refine the statement based on their input to ensure it resonates with all parties involved.
4. **Document the Vision:** Write the final vision statement in a structured format, ensuring it is prominently featured in the Architecture Definition Document.

<Example>
"Our vision is to create a robust, scalable, and secure enterprise architecture that enables seamless integration of business processes, enhances operational efficiency, and supports innovation. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and best practices, we aim to deliver a flexible and adaptive architecture that meets the evolving needs of our organization and drives sustainable growth."

## Business Problem Description

<Purpose>
The Business Problem Description outlines the core business challenge or opportunity that the solution architecture aims to address. This section grounds the technical work in a clear understanding of the business context. A well-defined problem statement helps ensure that the architecture aligns with business needs and delivers meaningful outcomes.

<Instructions>
1. **Clarify the Problem or Opportunity:** Define the key issue or opportunity driving the initiative. Focus on what’s broken, missing, inefficient, or at risk—without jumping into solutions.
2. **Use Business Terms:** Describe the problem in the language of the business. Avoid technical jargon. Emphasize impacts on business goals, customers, employees, or operations.
3. **Include Context and Evidence:** Support the description with data points, user stories, workflow diagrams, or references to audits or incidents. Show why this matters now.
4. **Define the Scope:** Indicate which areas of the business are affected and whether the problem is localized or systemic. This helps define boundaries for the architectural solution.
5. **Link to Strategic Objectives:** If possible, tie the problem to broader company goals such as growth, risk reduction, cost optimization, or customer satisfaction.

<Example>
**Business Problem:** The company’s customer onboarding process is fragmented across multiple systems, leading to inconsistent experiences, frequent delays, and high manual effort. Customers face a 5–7 day wait time due to handoffs between departments, while internal teams spend an average of 8 hours per onboarding case on redundant data entry and approvals. These inefficiencies contribute to customer churn, lower employee satisfaction, and missed revenue opportunities. The architecture must support streamlining this process through automation, integration, and a unified digital experience.

### Key Stakeholders

<Purpose>
The Key Stakeholders and Influence vs. Interest Mapping section identifies the main individuals, groups, or roles that have a vested interest in the success of the solution architecture and outlines how their influence and interest shape engagement strategies. Knowing who the stakeholders are and how much power and concern they bring ensures that the architecture meets organizational needs, addresses critical requirements, and secures needed support throughout the project lifecycle.

<Instructions>
1. **Identify Stakeholders:**  Work with project sponsors, business units, and technical leads to build a full list of stakeholders. Focus on individuals or groups who shape requirements, funding, governance, adoption, or maintenance of the solution.
2. **Describe Stakeholder Roles:**  For each stakeholder or group, explain their role, responsibilities, and how they interact with the architecture. Note whether they act as decision-makers, approvers, contributors, or end users.

3. **Assess Influence and Interest:**  Evaluate how much control each stakeholder has over the project's direction (influence) and how much they care about its outcomes (interest). High-influence stakeholders can change scope, funding, or priority. High-interest stakeholders see the solution's success or failure as important to their work or goals. Assign each stakeholder a simple rating of High, Medium, or Low for both influence and interest.

4. **Map Stakeholders to Engagement Strategies:**  Based on influence and interest, sort stakeholders into four groups:
   * Those with high influence and high interest must be **managed closely**. Engage them often and involve them in key decisions.
   * Those with high influence but low interest must be **kept satisfied**. Keep them informed enough to maintain their support without overloading them.
   * Those with low influence but high interest must be **kept informed**. Share updates and give chances for feedback, but they do not drive decisions.
   * Those with low influence and low interest should be **monitored with minimal effort**. Acknowledge them but do not devote major resources to engagement.
5. **Document Stakeholder Needs:**  
Capture key expectations, goals, pain points, or compliance concerns each stakeholder brings. This ensures the solution does not just meet technical goals, but also aligns with business needs and regulatory requirements.
6. **Engage Early and Often:**  
Plan how and when stakeholders will be engaged, such as through steering committees, feedback sessions, or milestone reviews. Record the planned engagement for each stakeholder group clearly.
7. **Validate the Stakeholder List and Mapping:**  
Review the list and the engagement strategies with the project sponsor and solution delivery leads. Make sure all key parties are captured and correctly categorized.

<Example>
The Executive Sponsor (CIO) holds high influence and high interest. They must be managed closely with regular briefings and active participation in steering committees.  
The Business Unit Lead for Customer Service holds medium influence and high interest. They should be kept informed through project newsletters and monthly review sessions.  
The IT Operations Manager holds high influence but medium interest. They should be kept satisfied with quarterly updates and design review touchpoints.  
The Field Technicians, who will use the solution daily, hold low influence but high interest. They should be included in user testing and training sessions.  
The Procurement Specialist holds low influence and low interest and requires only minimal updates tied to procurement milestones.

### Business & Technical Environments

<Purpose>
The Business & Technical Environments section defines the operational context in which the solution architecture will function. This section overlays the identified in-scope business processes onto the proposed solution landscape, ensuring that both business and technical environments are fully understood and aligned. Capturing these environments helps anchor the architecture within the real-world systems, departments, and workflows it must support and integrate with. A clear and complete environment description strengthens solution fit, highlights integration needs, and surfaces key constraints early in the process.

<Instructions>
1. **Describe the Business Environment:**  Identify and describe the business units, functions, workflows, and operational areas that fall within the scope of the architecture vision. Clearly state which parts of the business are directly affected and which are indirectly impacted. Include any relevant business drivers, operational goals, or strategic initiatives shaping the environment. If the business environment is still being finalized, indicate it as "To Be Determined" but describe the expected areas under consideration.
2. **Describe the Technology Environment:**  Outline the technology domains, platforms, and systems in scope for the architecture. Examples include Grid Operations systems, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Customer Information Systems (CIS), billing platforms, mobile field service systems, and cloud environments. Specify which systems the architecture will interact with, replace, extend, or depend upon.
3. **Overlay Business Processes onto Environments:**  Show how the in-scope business processes map onto the business and technology environments. Explain where each key process resides, which systems support them, and any notable gaps, overlaps, or dependencies. Use simple tables, bullet points, or mapping diagrams if necessary to make this relationship clear.
4. **Use Structured Formats for Clarity:**  Present environment details in a clean and structured way. You may use a two-column table (Business Environment | Technology Environment) to organize information. Be consistent and precise in naming systems, departments, and processes.
5. **Highlight Critical Integration Points and Constraints:**  Identify where the business and technical environments impose architectural constraints, such as legacy system limitations, regulatory compliance boundaries, high-availability needs, or integration bottlenecks.
6. **Mandatory Section:**  Completion of this section is **mandatory**. The solution architecture document must not proceed to later design sections without an agreed understanding of the business and technical environments in scope.

<Example>
Business & Technical Environments:

* **Business Environment:**
  * Customer Service Operations (Billing, Call Center Support)
  * Field Service Operations (Grid Maintenance and Repair Dispatch)
  * Energy Trading & Risk Management (ETRM) Unit
  * Regulatory Affairs (Compliance Reporting and Audit Readiness)
* **Technology Environment:**
  * Customer Information System (CIS)
  * SAP ERP Financials and Supply Chain
  * Mobile Field Service Application (MFSApp)
  * Grid SCADA System
  * Salesforce CRM for Customer Support
* **Overlay Summary:**
  * Customer billing processes occur within CIS and SAP ERP.
  * Field service dispatch links Mobile Field Service Application with Grid SCADA for outage management.
  * Regulatory reporting relies on data aggregated across SAP and Grid Systems.

### Cross Project Dependencies

<Purpose>
The Cross Project Dependencies section identifies other projects that may influence, constrain, or enable the success of the architecture effort. Dependencies can include overlapping system changes, shared resources, timing conflicts, or related initiatives delivering enabling capabilities. Recognizing and managing these dependencies early is critical to ensuring architectural alignment, avoiding rework, and reducing delivery risk. This section also fosters cross-team collaboration and promotes visibility across concurrent enterprise initiatives.

<Instructions>
1. **Identify Related Projects:**  
Work with the **Enterprise Architecture (EA) Team** and the **Business Relationship Manager (BRM)** to identify other projects within the enterprise that may introduce dependencies. These may be projects that deliver enabling components, share the same systems or teams, or are scheduled to go live in overlapping timeframes.
2. **Use Formal Identifiers:**  
For each dependency, reference the unique project identifier (where available) from formal planning systems such as **PPM**, or **ETS Operational Plan**. Include both the name and ID for traceability.
1. **Describe the Nature of the Dependency:**  
Provide a short description explaining how the success or timeline of your architecture project depends on, or is influenced by, the other project. Clarify whether the dependency is technical (e.g., shared APIs or infrastructure), business-driven (e.g., shared business process or customer impact), or resource-based (e.g., shared delivery teams or SMEs).
1. **Engage Peer BRMs:**  
The **BRM assigned to this architecture project** must coordinate with BRMs from the dependent projects. Together with the Solution Architect, they ensure the dependency is logged and tracked. Dependencies must be entered into Portfolio Management Toolto ensure visibility in planning and governance processes.
1. **Ensure Ongoing Monitoring:**  
Dependencies are not static. Establish a regular cadence to review, update, and manage the status of identified cross-project dependencies. Escalate changes in scope or schedule that could impact architectural alignment.

<Example>
Cross Project Dependencies:

1. **Dependent Project:** Customer Digital Experience Platform
   * **Project ID:** PPM360-04578
   * **Dependency Description:** This platform is responsible for delivering the unified customer identity layer that this architecture depends on for authentication and personalization features. Any delays or changes to their API contract would directly impact our timeline.
   * **BRMs Involved:** Jane Doe (Current Project), Mark Smith (Dependent Project)
   * **Logged in Portfolio Management:** Yes
2. **Dependent Project:** Grid Modernization Data Hub
   * **Project ID:** PPM-22143
   * **Dependency Description:** Our architecture relies on streaming data pipelines built as part of this initiative. Coordination is needed to ensure compatibility with our planned analytics services.
   * **BRMs Involved:** Jane Doe (Current Project), Priya Patel (Dependent Project)
   * **Logged in Portfolio Management:**  In Progress

<Prerequisites>
* Portfolio Management Tooling
* ETS/BRM Operational Plans

## Resulting Architecture Models

### Conceptual End-to-End Solution

<Purpose>
The Conceptual End-to-End Solution section defines the high-level architecture that addresses the business needs and capabilities outlined in previous sections. It presents a visual and narrative representation of the target state solution, illustrating how applications, capabilities, and systems interact across the enterprise. This section helps stakeholders understand the big picture before detailed designs are developed and supports alignment between technical delivery teams and business goals.

<Instructions>
1. **Create High-Level Diagrams:**  
Include architecture diagrams that depict the target conceptual solution. The diagram(s) should show major systems, platforms, integrations, user interaction points, and data flows. Focus on logical relationships and component roles—not implementation detail. Keep the level appropriate for executive and business stakeholder audiences while still informing technical planning.
2. **Provide Diagram Descriptions:**  
For each diagram included, write a narrative that explains what the diagram shows, how the parts relate, and how the diagram reflects the architecture vision. Describe how business capabilities are enabled by the depicted architecture. Clarify system boundaries, interaction flows, and any assumptions.
3. **Document Application Life Cycle States:**  For each application represented in the conceptual architecture, identify its current or planned **Application Life Cycle** status. Refer to **Orbus** for authoritative Application Life Cycle status. If introducing a new business capability with no current system in place, mark the life cycle status as **Deploy**. If introducing a new system to take over a capability from an existing solution, mark it as **Re-Platform**.  This helps clarify the degree of change involved and supports planning and impact analysis. The life cycle states to use are:
   * **Deploy** – New application introduced for a new business capability.
   * **Enhance** – Existing application remains in place but will receive new features or updates.
   * **Sustain** – Application remains unchanged but stays in use to support current capabilities.
   * **Re-Platform** – New application replaces one or more legacy systems to support the same or extended capabilities.
   * **Replace** – Application is being swapped out entirely due to obsolescence or functionality gaps.
   * **Decommission** – Application is being retired and removed from the portfolio.
4. **Ensure Consistency Across Views:**  
Align this section with related sections such as Business Processes, Actors, and Dependencies. Ensure terminology, system names, and roles are consistent.

<Example>
Conceptual End-to-End Solution:

* **Diagram Included:** High-level architecture map showing:
  * Customer Portal → API Gateway → Middleware → Billing System → SAP ERP
  * Identity Provider connected to Customer Portal and Mobile App
  * Data Integration Layer feeding Analytics Dashboard
* **Diagram Description:** The conceptual diagram shows how customer interactions are routed through the API Gateway to backend billing and ERP systems. Identity management is centralized through a shared identity provider. The solution also includes a data integration layer to support near real-time analytics for business insights.
* **Application Life Cycle Description:**
  * **Customer Portal:** (_Enhance_) - The Customer Portal will remain in use but will receive new features focused on personalization and user experience improvements.
  * **Billing System:** (_Sustain_) - The Billing System will continue operating without change. It will remain the core system supporting billing operations.
  * **New Middleware Layer:** (_Deploy_) - A new Middleware Layer will be introduced to manage system integration and data transformation between frontend and backend systems.
  * **Legacy Middleware:** (_Decommission_) - The Existing Legacy Middleware will be retired after the successful deployment of the new Middleware Layer.  Its current functions will be fully transitioned
  * **Analytics Dashboard:** (_Re-Platform)_ - The legacy business intelligence tool will be replaced by a new cloud-based Analytics Dashboard, providing modern reporting and insight capabilities.

### Other Architectural Options

<Purpose>
The Other Architectural Options section outlines alternative solution approaches that were considered during the architecture design process. This section documents the evaluation of different architectural paths and provides transparency into why certain options were not selected. Including this analysis helps stakeholders understand trade-offs, supports architectural governance, and ensures the chosen approach was based on a reasoned comparison of alternatives—not just assumed best practices or default patterns.

<Instructions>
1. **Identify Alternative Approaches:** List the architectural approaches, patterns, or platforms that were seriously considered but ultimately not selected. These could include variations in system integration patterns, infrastructure choices (e.g., cloud vs. on-premise), data management strategies, vendor solutions, or service orchestration models.
2. **Describe Each Option:** For each alternative, provide a brief but clear description. Identify the core idea, the technologies involved, and how the option would have addressed the business and technical requirements.
3. **Evaluate Strengths and Weaknesses:** For each option, highlight key advantages (e.g., lower cost, faster implementation, vendor alignment) and limitations (e.g., scalability issues, integration complexity, misalignment with roadmap). Include architectural trade-offs and constraints that influenced the decision.
4. **Explain the Decision Rationale:** Clearly articulate why the alternative was not selected. This could relate to technical feasibility, total cost of ownership, operational risk, organizational readiness, or alignment with long-term strategic goals. Link decisions back to stakeholder priorities or enterprise architecture principles where possible.
5. **Ensure Traceability and Transparency:** If applicable, cite reference materials, evaluation matrices, or meeting notes where the alternatives were discussed. The goal is to make the decision-making process auditable and repeatable.

<Example>
Other Architectural Options Considered:

1. **Hybrid Cloud Architecture (Cloud for Front-End, On-Prem for Back-End):**
   * _Description:_ This option proposed keeping the core transactional systems on-premises while migrating all customer-facing portals and mobile apps to a public cloud environment.
   * _Strengths:_ Improved scalability and flexibility for customer channels; potential for faster innovation cycles.
   * _Weaknesses:_ Increased integration complexity between cloud and on-prem systems; added latency and security challenges.
   * _Reason Not Selected:_ Ultimately not aligned with the enterprise’s cloud-first strategy and would have created duplicated infrastructure maintenance overhead.
2. **Single-Vendor Suite Solution:**
   * _Description:_ Leverage an end-to-end suite from a single vendor that covered CRM, billing, and case management.
   * _Strengths:_ Simplified integration, faster procurement, and consolidated vendor support.
   * _Weaknesses:_ Lower flexibility, lack of best-of-breed capabilities in certain domains, vendor lock-in.
   * _Reason Not Selected:_ The suite lacked maturity in several key capability areas needed by the business, and customization requirements would have undermined the advantages of the pre-integrated suite.

### Architectural Principles

<Purpose>
The Architectural Principles section outlines the core guidelines that shape and govern the design of the target architecture. These principles ensure that solution decisions align with broader enterprise goals and provide a consistent foundation for planning, execution, and future scalability. Architectural principles serve as a compass during trade-off discussions, solution evaluation, and design refinement, ensuring that the architecture remains coherent, sustainable, and strategically aligned over time.

<Instructions>
1. **Leverage Enterprise Architecture (EA) Standards:** Use the organization's formal **EA Vision, Mission, and Guiding Principles** as the primary source for selecting architectural principles. These documents establish the broader enterprise intent and should inform every architectural decision made in the project. 
2. **Select Relevant Principles:** Identify the specific architectural principles from the enterprise library that are most applicable to the solution being designed. Focus on those principles that directly influence technology choice, integration design, security patterns, scalability, maintainability, or user experience.
3. **Clearly Describe Each Principle:** For each principle included, provide a short but clear description. Explain what the principle means in the context of this solution and why it matters. Avoid simply copying the enterprise statement verbatim; tailor the explanation to the architecture’s needs.
4. **Connect Principles to Design Outcomes:** For each principle, briefly note how it shapes or constrains architectural decisions. Make clear connections between the guiding principle and solution choices to show traceability.

### Architectural Standards, Reference Models, Patterns, and Building Blocks

<Purpose>
The Architectural Standards, Reference Models, Patterns, and Building Blocks section describes the reusable guidance, frameworks, and components that inform and support the target architecture. This section ensures that solution designs align with recognized best practices, comply with internal and external standards, and make use of proven architectures wherever possible. Establishing a foundation of standards and patterns helps increase consistency, reduce risk, and improve maintainability across the enterprise.

<Instructions>
1. **Identify Relevant Standards:** Document the standards—both industry-wide (e.g., NIST, ISO, TOGAF) and internal to the organization—that are applicable to the solution architecture. Specify standards for areas such as security, data management, system integration, cloud adoption, application development, and infrastructure design.
2. **List Applicable Reference Models:** Include any enterprise reference models or frameworks that apply to the solution, such as Information Architecture Models, Security Reference Architectures, Integration Frameworks, or Cloud Adoption Frameworks. Reference official model names or versions where possible.
3. **Describe Architectural Patterns:** Identify and describe architectural patterns that should guide the solution design. Patterns might include Microservices Architecture, Event-Driven Architecture, Layered Architecture, API Gateway Patterns, or Domain-Driven Design. Explain why each pattern is appropriate and how it contributes to solving the business or technical challenges outlined earlier.
4. **Identify Architectural Building Blocks (ABBs):** List pre-existing, reusable architectural components or building blocks that the solution should leverage. Examples include authentication services, data pipelines, messaging platforms, enterprise APIs, shared cloud services, or UI component libraries. Clarify if these building blocks must be reused as-is or if extension or customization is permitted.
5. **Link Back to the Conceptual Architecture:** For each standard, reference model, pattern, or building block, briefly describe how it supports the conceptual end-to-end solution. Show traceability to architecture decisions wherever possible.
6. **Ensure Alignment and Validation:** Confirm that all listed standards and models align with enterprise strategy and current governance frameworks. Validate the selection with the Enterprise Architecture Team or Architecture Review Board if required.

<Example>

### Architectural Component Types

<Purpose>
The Architectural Component Types section classifies the systems and sub-systems within the solution according to their primary purpose and interaction model. This classification helps frame integration strategies, manage complexity, and align expectations around system behavior. It also highlights areas where system goals may conflict—particularly when combining innovation-driven systems with record-keeping systems—and ensures the architecture accounts for these differences.

<Instructions>
1. **List Systems and Sub-Systems:** Identify all major systems or sub-systems that are part of the solution architecture. Include both newly introduced components and existing components impacted by the project.
2. **Categorize Each System by Type:** For each system or sub-system, indicate which of the following architectural types it belongs to:
   * **System of Record:** Systems that serve as the authoritative source for business data (e.g., ERP, CRM, Financial Systems).
   * **System of Engagement:** Systems used for one-way communication where user actors consume information (e.g., websites, dashboards, notification systems).
   * **System of Interaction:** Systems enabling two-way communication between users and the system (e.g., portals, mobile apps, chatbots).
   * **System of Differentiation:** Systems that help set the organization apart from competitors by enabling decision-making, optimization, or unique service delivery.
   * **System of Innovation:** Systems based on emerging technologies not yet fully standardized by the industry (e.g., Blockchain, AR/VR, AIOps, MLOps, IoT devices).
3. **Explain System Interaction Models:** Provide a brief explanation of how each system interacts with users or other systems. Make clear whether the user is primarily consuming information, interacting with the system, or leveraging the system for competitive advantage or innovation.
4. **Address Architectural Challenges:** If Systems of Innovation are tied directly to Systems of Record, describe anticipated friction points. Highlight how integration will be handled and whether an Engagement or Interaction layer will be introduced to buffer the conflicting system goals.
5. **Plan for Evolution:** For any System of Innovation, outline a preliminary roadmap showing how the solution might transition the innovation into a more stable System of Engagement or Interaction over time, as technology and business processes mature.
6. **Use Structured Formats for Clarity:** Where useful, present the system listing and type classification in a structured format such as bullet points or a simple list. Tables can also be used for visual clarity but are not mandatory.

<Example>
Architectural Component Types:

* **Customer Information System (CIS):**
  * _Type:_ System of Record
  * _Interaction Model:_ Stores authoritative customer data, billing information, and service agreements.
* **Customer Web Portal:**
  * _Type:_ System of Interaction
  * _Interaction Model:_ Provides customers with two-way access to their account data and service requests.
* **Mobile Outage Notification App:**
  * _Type:_ System of Engagement
  * _Interaction Model:_ Sends real-time outage alerts to customers; users consume information but do not interact directly with back-end systems.
* **Predictive Maintenance AI Engine:**
  * _Type:_ System of Innovation
  * _Interaction Model:_ Uses machine learning to predict asset failures before they occur. This system drives innovation but creates integration friction when tied directly to the Asset Management System (a System of Record).
  * _Note:_ Integration between the AI Engine and Asset Management will occur through an Engagement Layer that decouples experimental models from authoritative records. A roadmap exists to mature the AI Engine into a validated System of Differentiation over the next 18 months.

### Software Development Lifecycle Selection

<Purpose>
The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Selection section defines the initial development methodology chosen to guide the solution delivery. Selecting an appropriate SDLC approach ensures that the solution development aligns with the maturity of the platform, complexity of the architecture, and readiness of requirements. This decision also provides a foundation for setting delivery expectations, managing risks, and organizing work across teams and subsystems.

<Instructions>
1. **Assess Platform Status:** Determine whether the solution is based on an existing, approved, and operational platform. If the platform is already mature and running, Agile-based approaches (e.g., Agile-DevOps, Agile-Scrum) may be used immediately. If the platform needs to be created, matured, or heavily customized as part of the project, a more structured SDLC such as Waterfall or Systems Engineering must be considered.
2. **Evaluate Prior Design and Implementation Considerations:**  Review whether prior designs, architectural models, or decompositions exist. If the design is already well defined and stable, lighter SDLC models can be adopted. If architecture scoping is still immature, or if detailed technical decomposition is needed, a more formal SDLC is required.
3. **Analyze Maturity of Architecture Scope:** Assess the overall maturity of the solution architecture. Immature or evolving architectures favor structured and phased approaches. Mature and stable architectures support more iterative, Agile methods.
4. **Select the Initial SDLC Approach:** Choose one of the following SDLC approaches for the overall solution:
   * **Agile-DevOps**
   * **Agile-SAFe**
   * **Agile-Scrum**
   * **Agile-Kanban**
   * **Platform Specific (if platform constraints dictate the SDLC model)**
   * **Systems Engineering**
   * **Vendor Specific (if the vendor provides a pre-defined SDLC model)**
5. **Provide Justification for the SDLC Selection:**   Explain the rationale for selecting the SDLC approach. Your justification should reference platform maturity, solution complexity, business delivery needs, team skillsets, vendor involvement, and project risk factors.
6. **Identify SDLC for Each Subsystem / Component:**  For solutions with multiple subsystems or major components, specify the SDLC approach selected for each. Subsystems tightly tied to stable platforms may use Agile, while platform-building subsystems may require Systems Engineering or Waterfall approaches.
7. **Ensure Stakeholder Alignment:**  Share the SDLC selection with key stakeholders, including project sponsors, delivery managers, and technical leads, to ensure broad agreement on development expectations and sequencing.

<Example>
Software Development Lifecycle Selection:

* **Overall Solution SDLC Approach:**
  * _Selection:_ Agile-DevOps
  * _Justification:_ The solution is built on an already approved and operational cloud platform. Platform services (identity management, billing integration) are mature and stable. Business priorities require frequent incremental releases and continuous improvement cycles, which aligns with Agile-DevOps principles.
* **Subsystem SDLC Approaches:**
  * _Customer Mobile App:_ Agile-Scrum, due to short development sprints and rapid UX iteration needs.
  * _Analytics Data Lake Extension:_ Agile-Kanban, due to a continuous flow of backlog items without strict sprint boundaries.
  * _New Grid Asset Management Platform:_ Systems Engineering, as it involves complex integration of SCADA telemetry, IoT sensor ingestion, and regulatory compliance requirements, requiring detailed upfront decomposition and phased validation.
