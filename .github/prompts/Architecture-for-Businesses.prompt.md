## Business Architecture

### Goals, Objectives, and Key Results

<Purpose>
This section clearly defines the business goals, objectives, and key results (OKRs) that the IT solution is intended to achieve. Documenting these elements ensures alignment between the proposed technology solution and the organization's strategic intentions. It serves as the foundational context for evaluating the solution's success, prioritizing project scope, and guiding stakeholders through decision-making processes.
</Purpose>
<Instructions>
1. Clearly articulate the high-level business goals this solution aims to fulfill. Goals should reflect strategic aspirations of the business area or organization.
2. List specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives aligned with each business goal.
3. Define key results for each objective, specifying measurable outcomes and milestones that will indicate successful progress and achievement.
4. Ensure each objective explicitly addresses how the proposed solution will support or enable achievement.
5. Collaborate with business stakeholders to validate and refine documented goals, objectives, and key results to ensure clarity, relevance, and completeness.
</Instructions>
<Example>
**Goal:** Improve customer satisfaction and retention.

* **Objective 1:** Enhance customer support responsiveness.

  * **Key Result 1:** Reduce average customer support response time from 24 hours to less than 4 hours by Q3 2026.
  * **Key Result 2:** Achieve an 85% customer satisfaction rating within 6 months after deploying the new solution.
* **Objective 2:** Increase self-service capabilities.

  * **Key Result:** Implement a self-service customer portal to reduce support call volume by 30% within 12 months post-launch.

**Goal:** Enhance operational efficiency.

* **Objective 1:** Streamline account onboarding.

  * **Key Result:** Automate the account onboarding process to reduce processing time from 7 days to 2 days by end of Q4 2026.
* **Objective 2:** Improve data accuracy and integrity.

  * **Key Result:** Integrate system data flows to reduce manual data entry errors by 50% within one year post-implementation.
</Example>
<Standards>
* Goals, objectives, and key results must align with strategic business directives and documented enterprise strategies.
* All objectives and key results should adhere to the SMART framework for clarity and effectiveness.
* Documentation must be validated and approved by relevant business owners and stakeholders.
* Clearly link each key result to measurable performance indicators.
* Refer to external industry standards, such as TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework), specifically sections pertaining to Business Architecture documentation (TOGAF 10 – Business Architecture, Section 7) and ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 standards for architectural descriptions, ensuring completeness, relevance, and adherence to recognized best practices.
</Standards>

## Impacted Business Capabilities

<Purpose>
This section identifies and describes the specific business capabilities impacted by the implementation of the IT solution. Clearly documenting impacted capabilities helps to clarify the scope of change, facilitates alignment between business and IT stakeholders, and ensures effective management of dependencies and interactions within the organization.
</Purpose>
<Instructions>
1. Identify and list each business capability directly or indirectly impacted by the proposed solution.
2. Describe the current state of each capability, including existing strengths, weaknesses, or known gaps.
3. Clearly articulate the expected changes or enhancements to each capability resulting from the solution implementation.
4. Highlight dependencies or integration points between impacted capabilities.
5. Validate this information with relevant business and IT stakeholders.
</Instructions>
<Example>
**Capability:** Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

* **Current State:** Disjointed customer data across multiple legacy systems causing inefficient customer interactions and lack of a unified customer view.
* **Expected Changes:** Consolidation of customer data into a unified CRM system, providing a comprehensive, real-time customer view, improved interaction efficiency, and enhanced customer analytics capabilities.

**Capability:** Order Management

* **Current State:** Manual processes with significant delay and error rates.
* **Expected Changes:** Automation of key processes reducing processing time by 60%, minimizing errors, and improving scalability for future growth.
</Example>
<Standards>
* Business capabilities must align with the organization's business architecture and capability model.
* Changes described must clearly demonstrate the intended value and benefit to each capability.
* Documentation should reflect integration with existing enterprise frameworks and standards such as TOGAF’s Business Architecture Capability Framework.
* Align capability documentation with external industry standards such as the Business Architecture Guild’s Business Architecture Body of Knowledge (BIZBOK® Guide).
</Standards>

## Impacted Business Processes

<Purpose>
This section documents the business processes associated with each impacted business capability. Clear documentation of business processes ensures a shared understanding of workflow, roles, responsibilities, and metrics, facilitating effective alignment, analysis, and optimization.
</Purpose>
<Instructions>
1. List and categorize business processes under their associated impacted business capabilities.
2. Provide clear and descriptive names for each business process.
3. Identify and document the owner of each process.
4. Include detailed descriptions of each process, highlighting key steps and interactions.
5. Document basic process metrics such as process duration, throughput, quality indicators, and associated costs.
6. Provide standardized process visualizations using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), Supplier-Input-Process-Output-Customer (SIPOC), and Value Stream Mapping (VSM).
7. Note clearly that Flowcharts and Customer Journey Maps are non-standardized and require additional dialogue to reduce ambiguity and avoid misunderstandings.

## Business Process Risk

<Purpose>
This section defines the purpose of conducting a Business Process Risk Assessment from an ISO 27001 perspective. It specifically addresses the evaluation of risks concerning Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) to ensure robust information security management within business processes.

**Confidentiality**

The purpose of assessing confidentiality is to ensure sensitive information is protected against unauthorized access or disclosure. Risks to confidentiality are evaluated to prevent data breaches, protect privacy, and ensure compliance with relevant laws and standards.

**Integrity**

The assessment of integrity aims to safeguard information from unauthorized modification or alteration. This evaluation ensures that business processes maintain accurate, reliable data and prevent errors or fraudulent activities that could compromise business operations.

**Availability**

Assessing availability ensures that business processes remain accessible and operational when needed. This evaluation identifies risks to the continuous functionality and timely recovery of systems, thereby minimizing disruptions and maintaining business continuity.
</Purpose>
<Instructions>
1. Document each risk event or condition following the guidelines provided below. Technical Debt, being a known issue, is not considered a risk. The methodology aligns with the PMI PMBOK and ISO 27001 standards.

2. **Risk Event**: Clearly describe each potential event or condition and the Source of that risk.

3. **Stakeholders:** Clearly describe the stakeholders impacted (both internal and external) for this risk.

4. **Risk Probability:** Evaluate each risk using the following scale:
